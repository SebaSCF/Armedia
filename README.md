## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


## In order to display data in the tables
JSON server must be started, by opening the terminal and inputting the command ``` json-server --watch db.json ```.
Data is stored in a JSON file, called ***db.json***, located in the main folder
